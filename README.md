# The Wild Oasis - Staff Application

A React + Supabase application allowing the staff of a fictitious boutique hotel
called Wild Oasis to manage operations related to bookings, modify the prices of
extras or add-ons, and tweak the restrictions for certain aspects of the
bookings, like minimum and maximum number of nights and guests per booking.
Built as part of learning React, its ecosystem of libraries and packages, and
Supabase for quick backend API creation. Employs React Query for API
integration, remote state management, and caching; React Router for routing; and
CSS Styled Components for styling.

The project is currently in development and not in a state to be tested by other
users. I will update the README.md once it is ready for deployment.
