# The Wild Oasis - Staff Application

A React + Supabase application allowing the staff of a fictitious boutique hotel
called Wild Oasis to manage operations related to bookings, modify the prices of
extras or add-ons, and tweak the restrictions for certain aspects of the
bookings, like minimum and maximum number of nights and guests per booking.
Built as part of learning React, its ecosystem of libraries and packages, and
Supabase for quick backend API creation.
